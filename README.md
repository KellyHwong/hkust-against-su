香港科技大学反对学生会不透明收取、使用学生会会费

## Letter 1

Dear finance office,

I am a PG student, and writing to you about the unreasonable payment mechanism of SU annual/initial membership fee. It is misleading that the SU annual membership fee payment is integrated to the HKUST tuition/hall fee Charges Due page at the beginning of every academic year.

1. The SU membership fee can be paid in Miscellaneous Purchases column already. It is unnecessary to put it on the Charges Due page at the beginning of the academic year.

2. Tuition fee, hall fee are compulsory in contrast to SU membership fee, which is optional. However, the coexistence of these fees is highly misleading that the SU membership fee is compulsory, especially for the freshmen or new PG student.

3. University has the obligation to inform our student that the SU membership fee is optional if the SU membership fee is placed on the due charged page.

4. There's no clear instruction as to how may student withdraw from the SU payment program. It is to the interest of justice that the school ought to provide the student with clear instructions as to how should students drop out from the SU membership scheme.

Best Regards,

Dear Prof. Chow,
I/We suggest to cancel/update the student membership fee collection by the university.
We have several reasonable reasons.

President Shyy shared his ideas about being open-minded, protecting diversity, we all admire that.
And this is why we appreciate and acknowledge HKUST.
So in common, any student group in ust is as equal as each other, however, the SU use this kind and convenient auto collection by the university, to make themselves the Authority of students. This is not fair for other groups, and does NOT fit the idea of our school.

Also as some voice on the wall in the atrium from students, they suggest we don’t pay the fee. We take that proposal. BUT, please keep updating the SIS system. Now it is still very inconvenient to avoid The fee payment.

As the same for other student groups, who collect the membership fee themselves, SU should also follow this to fit the ust idea of equality.

Sorry for bothering,

Best Regards.

Dear Prof. King CHOW,

I am a PG student, and writing to you about the payment to SU annual membership fee.
It is to our greatest concern that the SU annual membership fee payment is integrated to the HKUST tuition fee. More often than not, students pay the fee without noticing the fact that the tuition fees are integrated with SU fee. Moreover, there's no clear instruction as to how may student withdraw from the SU payment program . It is to the interest of justice that the school ought to notice student with the SU fee actively and provide student with clear instructions as to how should students drop out from the SU membership scheme.
Last but not least, HKUST SU has been a provisional student body from many years, without enough vote and recognition from students . We are worried about the misuse of our SU fee by the SU council, as all the fiscal and administrative decisions from SU council lack the support from the student. We, therefore, would like to urgent the school to investigate into the possibility of corruption and misuse of SU funding to uphold the value of integrity
I wish you all the best.
Best,
AAAAAA
