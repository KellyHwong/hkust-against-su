香港科技大学反对学生会不透明收取、使用学生会会费

## 诉求

Dear Prof. and President Shyy,
I/We have a strong suggestion to change the student union and representative framework.
We share the same ideas such as being open-minded, keeping diversity, and democracy, especially in which we need communication and negotiation.
However, democracy becomes the tyranny of the majority sometimes, as history shows.
In this current status, we strongly suggest, lower down the power of the student union. We have several terms.
First step, release the most recent financial report, such as, why and where the SU membership fee goes.
Secondly, cancel membership fee collection agency by the HKUST office.
Thirdly, let SU be a common student group such as other student groups, take off the meaning of official authority from the whole HKUST.

## 会费

Dear finance office,

I am a PG student, and writing to you about the unreasonable payment mechanism of SU annual/initial membership fee. It is misleading that the SU annual membership fee payment is integrated to the HKUST tuition/hall fee Charges Due page at the beginning of every academic year.

1. The SU membership fee can be paid in Miscellaneous Purchases column already. It is unnecessary to put it on the Charges Due page at the beginning of the academic year.

2. Tuition fee, hall fee are compulsory in contrast to SU membership fee, which is optional. However, the coexistence of these fees is highly misleading that the SU membership fee is compulsory, especially for the freshmen or new PG student.

3. University has the obligation to inform our student that the SU membership fee is optional if the SU membership fee is placed on the due charged page.

4. There's no clear instruction as to how may student withdraw from the SU payment program. It is to the interest of justice that the school ought to provide the student with clear instructions as to how should students drop out from the SU membership scheme.

Best Regards,
